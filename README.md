## What I learned

During this project, i learned how to use Chakra-Ui and how to use rawg-io api. I also learned how to use React Query for client-side caching, Zustand for state-management and Vite for packager bundler. Also strengthens my knowledge of React Router v6 Custom Hooks and Typescript.
