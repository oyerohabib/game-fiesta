## Process

1. First create a static mockup of the website using Chakra Ui.
2. Then create a dynamic mockup of the website using React Query and Zustand.
3. Then create a responsive mockup of the website using Chakra Ui media query.

### Built with

-   Chakra-Ui
-   React Query
-   Zustand
-   Vite
-   Typescript
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Semantic HTML5 markup

## What I learned

During this project, i learned how to use Chakra-Ui and how to use rawg-io api. I also learned how to use React Query for client-side caching, Zustand for state-management and Vite for packager bundler. Also strengthens my knowledge of React Router v6, Custom Hooks and Typescript.
